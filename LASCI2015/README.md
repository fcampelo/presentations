## Tutorial: _Design of Experiments and Statistical Comparison of Evolutionary Agorithms_  
**Place:** Latin American School of Computational Intelligence, Curitiba, Brazil  
**Date:** October 13, 2015

**Abstract**: Evolutionary computation is maturing into a solid, widely recognised field, and most of this development is driven by a strong experimental component. However, methodological flaws still motivate criticism and skepticism from a number of researchers - and they are not wrong. This tutorial introduces the main components needed for performing statistically and methodologically sound experiments with evolutionary algorithms, and discusses some advanced concepts involved in the design of experiments and derivation of well-supported conclusions. The tutorial also provides practical advice for avoiding the most common pitfalls in experimental EA research.

**Note**: I am providing the source files (Latex) in case anyone wants to reuse some of this material (please just cite the source :) ). However, since some of the figures are not mine, I am reluctant to make them available here (their original addresses and authors are provided in the text). If you want some of the ones that _are_ mine please drop me a line at [fcampelo@ufmg.br](mailto:fcampelo@ufmg.br) and I’ll be happy to send you the originals.
