\bitems \textit{HARKing} tends to greatly increase the rate of false positives in favor of the ``proposed approach'';

Sampling more hairs from a given head improves the precision of our estimate for that particular head, but \textit{\textbf{it does not increase our effective sample size!}}
\vone
In this example, performing statistical tests considering the 300 individual measurements (10 heads, 30 hairs per head) as independent values would falsely inflate our degrees of freedom.
\vone
This common mistake is called \textit{pseudoreplication}, and results in a much higher rate of false positives in statistical tests.
\vone
A simple solution is to use the average hair length per head\\
as the individual data points.

\textit{Blocking} is the principle behind well-known techniques for comparing algorithms on multiple instances, such as \textit{Friedman's test} and \textit{Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test};

However, the usually shunned parametric counterparts (\textit{blocked ANOVA} and \textit{paired t-tests}) also deserve some attention;

Parametric methods usually present larger power (i.e., greater sensitivity) and are simpler to understand.

{Reporting of results}
{Tell the whole story}
Avoid \textit{cherrypicking} your results;
\vone
Report and describe anomalous results and outliers (even if they are discarded in the modeling phase);
\vone
Exercise \textit{extreme} caution when discarding outliers!
\vone
Detail stop criteria, computational cost, and any other relevant information for the understanding and reproducibility of your results.
\vone
Whenever possible, share your code! It's good for the field as a whole (for reproducibility), and it is good for your paper (for citations)!

Conclusions should be based on solid evidence from the data;

Be conservative - don't exaggerate the generality of the results;

Report significance levels, effect sizes, and the assumptions under which the results are valid;

\textit{Suggest explanations} to the observed results;

Be careful with \textit{anomaly hunting};
